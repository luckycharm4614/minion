Test Strategy:

1. Software testabilities:
Simplicity-->         2
Understandability-->  5
Suitability-->        3
Stability-->          4

2. Test factors that are to be considered to test this software:
a) Correctness--> Integration testing
b) Authorization-->x--Authentication(security)--> Integration
c) Continuity of Processing--> Post uat
d) Service level
e) Access controls--> System testing
f) Methodology
g) Reliability--> This factor comes in all products--> Uat
h) Maintanable
i) Portable
j) Performance--> System testing
k) Ease of Operation
l) Integrity(How accurate the data is)--> System testing


3. Access drivers that would influence testing:
a) Authorization-->Quality analyst-->Validation/black box testing
b) Correctness-->Quality analyst-->Validation/black box testing or dynamic testing
c) Continuity of Processing-->Client/Management-->Verification
d) Access control-->Tester
e) Reliability-->Client/Management
f) Performance--> Tester
g) Integrity--> Tester


Test Plan:
a) Test item(Application name)
b) Software risk issues-->Security, Performance, Testing the browser, Platform, Browser, Configuration
c) Features to be tested--> Register user, Customer, Admin functions, Manager
d) Features not to be tsted--> New version need not be tested
e) Approach--> Black/White box testing
f) Test deliverables--> Source code, Test Scenario, Test plan, Test case, Test execution,Test report, Defect report
g) Iten pass/Fail criteria--> If it has 1 major bug, 5 minor bugs with no critical/Show stopper, the application is pass
h) Suspension and resumption criteria--> Show stoppers in application/Non availability of resources-->When it is resolved
i) Responsibility-->Project Manager, Test Lead, Tester, Customer
j) Staffing and training need--> How many testers are required, Which area you need training
k) Schedule-->Time to complete the work (2-3 weeks)
